Project Description:
Parabank is a virtual banking application used for simulating and testing financial transactions. 
It is not a real financial institution, but it can be utilized like a real banking application during software testing processes.
The listed testing environments are designed for performing various transactions that users can execute in a web-based banking application. 
They are essential tools for simulating financial activities such as account opening, money transfers, applying for loans, and bill payments. 
These environments facilitate the implementation of different test scenarios.

Project Objectives:

Enhance Functional Test Automation: The primary objective of the project is to
automate the functional UI tests. This aims to verify the functionality of the Parabank web
application through automated scenarios.

Sprint Mode: As with every week, in this sprint, we aim to complete specific
functional tests within a defined timeframe and complete automation of a specific section of
the application.

Tools and Technologies: The project will utilize tools and technologies such as Jira,
Xray, GitHub, Java, Selenium, TestNG, Cucumber, and Maven. These tools will assist in
effectively managing and automating functional tests.

Skill Development: Participants aim to enhance their skills in the mentioned tools
and technologies during the project. This focuses on improving the technical aspect of the
project and the personal skills of participants.

Verification and Documentation: At the end of the sprint, the team lead will share
the project's GitHub repository link in the Discord #projects channel. This ensures
continuous monitoring of project progress and documents the results in a clear and
understandable manner.

Iterative Improvements: The project aims for continuous improvement in test
automation and functional tests. Feedback will be collected between iterations, and tests and
automation processes will be enhanced based on this feedback.

Enhancing User Experience: Functional tests aim to improve the user experience.
These tests help identify and rectify errors and issues that users may encounter.
